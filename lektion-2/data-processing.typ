=== pandas for data loading from URLs and file handling

=== sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split for data splitting

=== sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler for feature scaling

=== pd.get_dummies() for automatic categorical encoding

=== Binary classification (wine quality, customer churn)

=== Multi-class classification (student grades - 8 classes)

=== Different activation functions: tanh, sigmoid, relu, softmax

=== Binary crossentropy vs sparse categorical crossentropy

=== Validation split during training

=== Production prediction workflows with new data preprocessing

=== Different model architectures (varying depths and neuron counts)
